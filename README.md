These are some Mechanism commands.
# Is this about?
This repository contains languages ``` Javascript, Python ```
these commands were developed to maintain a secure server, if you notice any errors feel free to contact me.

This is just the ChatBot code, it is not added.
Maybe in the future it will be added.

print ("[BOT] Mechanism: Hola")
ans = input()
